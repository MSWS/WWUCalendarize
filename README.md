# WWUParse

I'm too busy to handle my own calendar. Let's just write a script to scrape WWU's calendar site to automatically add events to my calendar.

WWU Website: https://registrar.wwu.edu/important-dates-deadlines

**Usage**: Run once, log in to google, and update the calendar id in the script. (If you can't figure this out then you probably shouldn't be using this script)
